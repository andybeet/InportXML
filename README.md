# InportXML
Development of template XML files for Inport

We aim to develop a simple framework to facilitate easy upload of metadata to Inport.
After upload very little extra effort will be required to ensure PARR compliance.

Benefits: 
1. Reduce duplication of effort in entering data (Data collector into a spreadsheet, then data entry into Inport)
2. Reduce need to rely on Inport GUI
3. Reproducability of metadata for importing into alternativeime databases (ERDAPP)
